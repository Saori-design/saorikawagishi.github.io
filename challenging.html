    <p>Being vegan is not easy. If we go to a supermarket or restaurants, most of food including meats or daily products. Especially in Japan, vegan is not as common as America, it is hard to find vegan food. Only way I can follow the vegan lifestyle is making vegan meal every time. Firstly, I have got nutrition problem. Protein is one of essential nutrition for humans. I needed to take protein from vegetables or plants, so that I had to eat soy beans everyday. Of course, I got bored with same vegan menu, but I could find variety of vegan recipe at the time.</p>
